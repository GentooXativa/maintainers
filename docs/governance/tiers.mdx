# Tiers

We use tiers to classify the projects in our organization. This classification is used to define the level of support that we provide to each project.

**How this classification will affect the maintainers?**

First of all, the criteria used per tier are not strict, the final decision is made by us as a group and not only by technical criteria. As well some projects are hard to classify like awesome-*

- **Tier 0** will require a lot of support from the `@onebeyond/maintainers` team in order to consolidate the project in our Open Source culture, IT resources, guidance...
- Tier 1 will require active monitoring from the `@onebeyond/maintainers` and the code owners for security patching, code review priority...
- Tier 2 will require some work from the code owners peer year to keep up with the dependencies, etc...
- Tier 3 will require some work from the `@onebeyond/maintainers` to deprecate the libraries, remove IT resources and archive the projects.

**When and who decided the project tier?**

The tier is decided by the `@onebeyond/maintainers` team and the code owners. The tier is reviewed every year and the tier can be changed at any time.




## Tier 0: Incubate

The starting point for new projects.

### Criteria:

- The project was created in the last 12 months
- The project didn't release v1.0.0 yet
- The project is not yet following all the guidelines from the org (code, automations, metafiles...)


## Tier 1: Active

The projects that are growing.

### Criteria:

- The project is under active development including business logic evolution (at least one release in the last year).
- The project has a roadmap
- The project is following all the guidelines from the org (code, automations, metafiles...)

## Tier 2: Maintenance

The consolidated projects that our community relays on but does not require any active development in terms of business logic.

### Criteria:

- The project is done in terms of business logic but is actively used by the community, so the project Maintenance tasks are mostly updating dependencies and fixing minor bugs.
- The project has completed the roadmap


## Tier 3: End Of Life

The projects that are not actively used by the community.

### Criteria:

- The project is considered completed and is not actively used by the community.
- The project has not done any release in the last 3 years.
